# Real-Time-Chat-Application
Created in python using socket programming. Socket programming involves establishing a connection between two nodes on a network, the server acting as a listener on a specific port and IP address while the client initiates the connection. The connection allows up to 5 clients to connect to the server and exchange messages between other clients. 

Installation: 
1. Open terminal and type following command or directly download from this page.   

git clone https://github.com/avim505/Real-Time-Chat-Application

2. First run the server side script by opening command prompt at project root directory and type 

python server.py 

3. Once the server is running, open another command promopt at project root directory and type 

python client.py 

4. Enter a username into the GUI and click "Join".

5. If you head back to the command promopt where the server is running, it will state that a client has sucessfully connected. 

6. Repeat step 3 to connect another client to the server to exchange messages between the intial client connected.
